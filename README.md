Python script that includes the basic following steps for a personal fitness tracker :

Data Collection: Collect fitness data (e.g., steps, distance, calories, etc.).<br>
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data.<br>
Data Analysis: Analyze the data to extract insights.<br>
Predictive Modeling: Use scikit-learn to build a predictive model.<br>


You can extend this script by adding more features, improving the predictive model, and integrating it with real fitness data sources 
(e.g., fitness trackers, mobile apps, etc.).
